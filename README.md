# portfolio_backend

## Project Objective

The objective of the backend is to provide a secure and reliable server-side application that supports the portfolio website by:

 . Handling API requests from the frontend (especially contact form submissions).

 . Validating and processing user input before saving.

 . Storing data securely in MongoDB using Mongoose.

 . Ensuring smooth communication between frontend and database.

 . Providing a scalable and maintainable REST API structure for future expansion (e.g., adding blog posts, project data, or authentication).

 The backendâ€™s objective is to manage data flow between the frontend and MongoDB, ensuring form submissions and user interactions are processed securely and efficiently.

 ## Brief Description

 The portfolio-backend is a Node.js and Express.js application that serves as the server-side component of the portfolio website. It provides REST API endpoints to handle contact form submissions from the frontend, validates the data, and stores it securely in MongoDB using Mongoose.

## Challenges Faced & Solutions
- **Challenge:** Database Connection Errors
  **Solution:** Added the correct MongoDB URI in .env, enabled access for all IP addresses in MongoDB Atlas, and used mongoose.connect() with proper options (useNewUrlParser, useUnifiedTopology).

- **Challenge:** Form Data Validation
  **Solution:** Created a Mongoose schema with required fields (name, email, message) and added validation logic to reject invalid entries.
